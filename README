	F-ZIX: burn all ZIX archives

The ZIX archive format is a bogus format designed to perpetuate a scam (to
install their garbage adware software).  On the off chance you got screwed by
this format, rather than installing their scumware, unpack the archive with
this utility.  Then delete the ZIX archive.

Also keep in mind that often times, the "files" you downloaded in a ZIX archive
are not real. The WinZix guys are crap flooding sites with bogus files that are
named as things you may want, but the content is actually random garbage data.
If the utilties here unpack the archives and the resulting files are crap, then
it's most likely they were crap to begin with.
